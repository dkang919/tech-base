## 1. Intention

**What was supposed to happen?**

* Win a club level international speech contest at my Toastmaster club.

---

## 2. Result

**What actually happened?**

* Did not prepare the script despite having 2 months (since Dec).
* Withdrew from the contest as I was not prepared.

---

## 3. Gap Analysis

**Why was there a difference? [Root Cause]**

* **Preparation Failure:** Failed to specify enough time to finalize the script. Did not prepare the script in advance.
* **Overconfidence:** Thought I had most things covered in my head, leading to procrastination.
* **Fragmented Focus:** Had too many plans for various parties (friends, dates, community, work, side-projects, workout).
* **Root Cause:** Built too many goals simultaneously. This led to a **fragmented time budget** and **partitioned focus**, pushing the timeline for tasks I underestimated.

## 4. Action Plan

**What will we do differently? [System Update]**

### 🟢 Start

* **Target 'Done' over 'Perfect':** Lower the goal to get back to the habit of completion. Draft first, polish later.
* **The 'Half-way' Rule:** 스피치 예약 시점부터 발표일까지 딱 **중간 지점**에 초안(Draft)이 없으면, 퀄리티 불문하고 무조건 튜터/멘토에게 보여주고 피드백을 강제로 받는다.
* **Time Budgeting:** Buy enough time budget and plan exactly what I want to finish on a scheduled date.

### 🔴 Stop

* **Limit Active Projects to 3:** Don't plan too much. 동시에 진행하는 중요 프로젝트/약속을 3개 이하로 제한한다. 하나가 끝나기 전엔 새 약속을 잡지 않는다.

### 🔵 Continue

* Plan ahead of the time.

### ⚠️ Rules (Kill Criteria)

* **The "D-7 Kill Switch":** Get a drawback plan in advance. 행사 **7일 전**까지 리허설 가능한 상태가 아니면, 그 즉시 포기 선언을 한다. (행사 직전 포기 방지)
